# FinalProject

Our final project for Grand Circus was an AngularJS app that utilized either an API (but NOT google maps) or a database to gather or store information. We worked in groups of four and had approximately two weeks to fulfill all of the requirements (see below). My group created a book exchange app using the Google Books and Mailjet APIs in addition to a database to update, store and match user information.

SQL Queries

"SELECT * FROM userinfo;"

"SELECT * FROM library;"

"SELECT * FROM watchlist;"

INSERT INTO watchlist (title, author, isbn, thumbnailurl)
values('', '', '', '');
